# CrowdCheck
**CrowdCheck** is a Chrome extension that aims to dispel misinformation, or at the very least, inform users of potentially dishonest websites. It achieves this by crowdsourcing page votes from other users, similar to Redditâ€™s upvote and downvote system. So long as users are logged in with their Google account, they can freely participate in ranking pages they frequent, and receiving ratings from others.
